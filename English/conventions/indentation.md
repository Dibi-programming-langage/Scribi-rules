In Skribi the indentation isn't needed but highly recommended.
Given a block of code, everything in that block must be shifted 4 spaces to the right from the outside of it. **The indentation don't define the block of code**
What should be indented :
- conditions
- loops
- etc ....

Example 1 :
```skribi
outside block
    inside block
```

Example 2 :
```skribi
outside
    block1
	    sub-block1
	block2
	    sub-block2
```

Issue raised : indentation isn't necessarily for a block of code
