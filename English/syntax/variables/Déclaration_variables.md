Given a foo variable of Uiui type, to create this variable you must :
```skribi
foo:Uiui = value
```
Or
```skribi
foo = valeur
```

It is possible to declare a variable at any time.

# Null
It is possible to make a declaration with a `null` value or to not put `= value` (the value, in this case, will be `null`) but in this case you must give the type.


**Null is not in Dibi yet**
